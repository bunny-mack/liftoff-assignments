# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is a web application that hosts user profiles and reviews for various categories of interest. Users are able to register for an account and create a profile with bio and photo. Users can then create, edit, and delete reviews for given categories (movies, books, and local restaurants). Users will find the ability to “like” reviews and other accounts useful. “Liking” a review saves the post in the “Favorites” section of the user’s profile for easy future reference. “Liking” another user account prioritizes new reviews from that profile in the user’s main feed so they see it first.
The idea came from our group brainstorming on how nice it would be to have a site that combined the helpful reviews and ratings of Google or Yelp with the interest and values alignment that Facebook and Instagram generate—get the reviews you want from the people who align most with your own tastes.

### Features
User login: User can register for an account with authentication and log in or log out. Each user will have a profile page featuring a bio, photo, and reviews they’ve posted or liked.

Post Review: User can create/edit/delete a review.

Search & Filter: User can search reviews using search terms, and filter reviews by categories within each type of review. For example, a user can filter movies by genre, actor, release date, or search all reviews for “Star Wars.”

Sort: User can sort reviews by A-Z, Highest Rating, Most Reviews

Favorites: Users can favorite individual reviews, which will then populate on their profile under “Liked Reviews” or favorite other accounts so that those reviews populate first on their feed

### Technologies
We will use Java, JavaScript, MySQL, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
We will use JavaScript to make the front-end more interactive and visually appealing. We will also look into using APIs to populate the items within certain categories.
